Student's Registration Portal
The Student's Registration Portal is a Java-based program designed 
to facilitate the registration process for students at Haramaya University. 
The program allows students to enter their personal and academic information,
view the entered information, make corrections if necessary, and finally submit their registration details. 
The portal also provides an option for registering another student or logging out of the system.
